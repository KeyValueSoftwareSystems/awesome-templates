You can use these templates directly in your codebase, automation tools, or communication platforms.

## Example

    subject: "ðŸš¨ Fraud Alert on {{account_number}} â€“ Immediate Attention Required"
    body: |
      Hi there,
      Weâ€™ve detected a potentially fraudulent charge on your account **{{account_number}}**:
      â€¢ Amount: {{transaction_amount}}
      â€¢ Merchant: {{merchant_name}}
      ...
  sms:
    text: >
